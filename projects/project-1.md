<ul>
  <li>Applied Numpy-based image filtering to remove noise and slice out the essential portions of the scan images.</li>
  <li>Created consistent data models and streamlined the entire data pipeline for machine learning and modelling.</li>
  <li>Applied CNNs and Multi-instance classification to classify images increasing accuracy to 84% from 69%.<li>
</ul>

The development of the tools and modules in the project are done using state-of-the-art platforms and technologies such as Python, Numpy, Pandas, SciKit, Keras & TensorFlow. The source code is completely open source.
